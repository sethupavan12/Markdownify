KING

A COMICS BIOGRAPHY

THE SPECIAL EDITION

by HO CHE ANDERSON

Figure — Cover illustration (detailed): A full-page painted portrait occupying the lower three-quarters of the page, showing a man in three-quarter profile turned to the viewer’s right, captured mid-speech with mouth open and visible teeth. He wears a dark suit jacket, a white dress shirt with a pointed collar, and a solid dark tie. A cluster of vintage-style broadcast microphones is visible near his chest at the lower right of the portrait. To the right edge of the image is a large, partially visible flag with a blue field containing indistinct white star-like shapes and a red-and-white triangular stripe at the bottom-right corner. The background behind the man consists of pale, large rectangular stone blocks or columns rendered with painterly brushstrokes. Across the top quarter of the page is a wide black horizontal band containing the single word “KING” in very large, muted-gray uppercase serif letters that span most of the band’s width. Centered beneath the band and above the portrait are the lines “A COMICS BIOGRAPHY” (small caps serif), then “THE SPECIAL EDITION” (larger serif, underlined in the original), and below that the byline “by HO CHE ANDERSON” in small caps. The overall color palette is cool and muted with strong contrast between the dark band, the mid-tone painted portrait, and the bright white margins framing the page; visible brush texture and painterly shading convey a hand-painted, illustrative style.
