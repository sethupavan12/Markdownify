Figure: Close-up of a neon sign reading "ATHENS" in uppercase letters. Each character is formed from thick glass tubing with a bright cyan outer glow and a vivid white-to-pale interior; there is a saturated red fill or inner glow visible inside the letter shapes. The letters are set against a very dark (near-black) background, creating strong contrast and prominent neon halos. The word is rendered on a slight horizontal arc, letters evenly spaced and slightly rounded in a vintage diner/neon-script style; joints and bends of the glass tubing are visible at letter corners, and the overall image is a tight crop focusing solely on the illuminated lettering with no surrounding context.
