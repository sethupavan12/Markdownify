As shown in the figure, AB parallel EF, then angle ACD = ()  
Answer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.

- A. 120°
- B. 130°
- C. 140°
- D. 150°

Figure (detailed description):
- A horizontal line labeled AB at the top, with point A at the left end and point B at the right end.
- A second horizontal line labeled EF at the bottom, with point E at the left and point F at the right; point D lies on EF between E and F.
- The two horizontal lines AB and EF are parallel (AB ∥ EF).
- From point A a slanted segment descends to the right and meets point C; the angle between AB (to the right from A) and this slanted segment at A is marked 50° (the 50° label is on the interior between the slanted segment and the top horizontal line).
- At point C the slanted segment bends into a vertical segment that goes straight down to point D on EF.
- At point D there is a small square marking a right angle between the vertical segment CD and the bottom horizontal line EF (so CD ⟂ EF).
- Points roughly positioned: A at upper-left, B at upper-right, slanted segment from A down-right to C, vertical down from C to D on the lower horizontal EF.
