# Germans: Majority Prefer Strong Ties with U.S.

Which is more important for Germany — to have strong ties with the U.S. or strong ties with Russia?

Figure — Pie chart showing responses:
- The chart is a circle divided into four wedges. The largest wedge, about 57% of the circle and colored a darker olive-green, is labeled "Strong ties with U.S. 57%." A roughly one-fifth wedge, about 21% and a lighter olive tone, is labeled "Equally close ties (VOL) 21%." A smaller wedge, about 15% and an even lighter green, is labeled "Strong ties with Russia 15%." The smallest wedge, about 7% and the palest shade, is labeled "Don't know 7%." Labels are placed adjacent to or within each wedge.
