Image description â€” detailed visual transcription and scene description:

A close-up photograph of two large plastic laundry product containers placed on a quilted floral mattress cover. The right container is white with a predominantly pink and purple product label; the left container (partially visible) is bright yellow and appears to be a second plastic jug positioned in the foreground, occupying the left third of the frame and obscuring part of the white container. The white container's label shows three rolled towels (cream, beige, and light gray) arranged diagonally near the top-left of the label area, with small stylized white and pink flowers scattered around them. In the upper-right of the label is an orange square with the brand name rendered as "BiG" (stylized with a lowercase "i") in white, and the word "VALUE" in white beneath it.

Across the lower-middle of the label is a curved purple banner with yellow uppercase text reading "PELEMBUT PAKAIAN" (the yellow text has a slight drop shadow). Immediately after that phrase on the purple banner, in smaller yellow/white mixed text, is "Fabric Softener" and below that in a cursive white script is "Floral Fresh". In the lower-right corner of the label is a small blue ribbon-shaped badge containing the white text "5L" indicating volume. Above that badge, on the label, the bilingual net content phrasing appears as "Net Content / Kandungan Bersih" (small print). The mattress beneath the jugs is quilted white with a repeating floral print in muted greens, pinks, and yellows; the photo lighting comes from a flash or bright direct light, creating specular highlights on the yellow jug and some shadow beneath the containers. The image is tightly cropped: edges of both jugs are cut off by the frame.

Transcribed visible text (preserving visual casing and order as seen):

- BiG VALUE
