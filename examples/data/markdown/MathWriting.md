Figure: Hand-drawn abstract sketch

- Overall: large, sparse black-ink pen strokes on a white background forming disconnected abstract marks across the page.
- Upper left quadrant: several short, curved, loose scribbles resembling quick pen gestures; two taller, narrow upward strokes just to their right.
- Center-left: a long, slightly downward‑curving horizontal line extending rightwards; near its right end the line terminates in a small right-pointing arrowhead.
- Lower center-left: two long vertical strokes rising from beneath the horizontal line, one with a short inward curl about one-third of the way up, forming a rough, tall “T”-like outline beneath the horizontal element.
- Center: a tall, thin, slightly curved vertical stroke with a small looped flourish near its lower third.
- Center-right: a cluster of tall, narrow, slanted strokes and angular loops grouped closely together, creating shapes that suggest hurried handwritten marks or numerals.
- Far right: a large oval loop drawn vertically, intersected by a short horizontal stroke inside the oval near mid-height.
- Negative space: wide expanses of white space surround each group of marks, giving the composition an airy, minimalist appearance.
