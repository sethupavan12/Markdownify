Peter wants to colour in the cells of a 3×3 square so that every row, every column and both diagonals each have three cells with three different colours. What is the smallest number of colours with which Peter can achieve this?

Figure: A blank 3×3 grid consisting of nine equal square cells arranged in three rows and three columns. The grid is drawn with a thick black outer border and thick equally spaced internal vertical and horizontal lines forming the nine cells. Each cell interior is blank and unnumbered; the intersection points of the lines are centered within the grid.
