## Internship Application Flowchart

Figure: Flowchart showing the internship application process, arranged vertically from top to bottom. At the very top is an oval labeled "Start". A downward arrow leads to a rectangular box centered below labeled "Research Suitable Internship Opportunities". From that box a left-leaning arrow goes to a rectangular box labeled "Prepare Your Application", which in turn leads down to "Reach Out for Recommendations", then to "Submit the Application". From "Submit the Application" a downward arrow goes to a diamond labeled "Got Response?". The diamond has two outputs:
- The left/lower output labeled "Yes" goes downward to a rectangular box "Prepare for Interview", then downward to another diamond "Got Internship?". That diamond has two outputs:
  - The left output (when Yes) goes to a rectangular box "Accept Offer and Prepare", then down to an oval "End".
  - The right output (when No) goes to a rectangular box "Ask for Feedback and Continue Applying". From that box an upward vertical arrow labeled "Continue" returns to "Research Suitable Internship Opportunities".
- The right/upward output from "Got Response?" labeled "No" follows a curved arrow returning to "Research Suitable Internship Opportunities".

Layout details: the main upward return path from both "Got Response? -> No" and "Ask for Feedback and Continue Applying -> Continue" feed back into the single "Research Suitable Internship Opportunities" box at the center top of the flow. The flow uses standard process symbols: ovals for Start/End, rectangles for process steps, diamonds for decision points; arrows indicate direction and labeled Yes/No outcomes on decision branches.

Step-by-step flow (textual sequence with branches):

8. Got Internship?

   - No: Ask for Feedback and Continue Applying -> return to step 2 (Research Suitable Internship Opportunities)
