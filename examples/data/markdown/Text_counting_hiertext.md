Figure: iPhone screenshot â€” foursquare dialog over a venue listing

Transcription of dialog box text:
> foursquare  
> Since you're so close to The New York Times, Jennifer D. says: Put on a fedora, suspenders, smoke a cigar. Tell the hot secretary to get you a cup of coffee and watch her walk away. Break open a story. Get on A1. Have a whiskey. Call it a day.

On-screen elements (detailed):
- Status bar: carrier "AT&T", signal "3G", time "12:57 PM", battery indicator at top right.
- Navigation/header area: title shows "Schnipper's Quality..." (partial due to cropping) with a plus (+) button at the right of the header.
- Venue listing behind dialog:
  - Venue name: "Schnipper's Quality Kitchen"
  - Address line: "620 8th Ave (at 41st)"
- Modal dialog (centered, semi-opaque background):
  - Title: "foursquare" (centered at top of the modal)
  - Main message: the quoted text (see transcription above)
  - Two buttons at the bottom of the dialog: "Close" (left) and "Save" (right)
- Bottom tab bar (visible behind dialog):
  - Tabs left to right: "Friends", "Places" (selected), "To-Do", "Badges", "More"
- Visual style notes:
  - The dialog is a rounded rectangular alert with a blue gradient title area and white text body.
  - The background venue listing is dimmed by the modal overlay.
  - Partial cropping at left and right edges; some text truncated in the header.
