It might have been 1974. I was using [bluesman] Fats Waller in my film Eraserhead, and I had written lyrics for a song called "In Heaven," and I needed the music for that, and I needed a girl to sing that. So I ended up at Peter Ivers' house with my friend (and Eraserhead sound designer) Alan Splet, and lo and behold, he saw a [Fats Waller] album, and he thought the album was out of print and completely rare, but Peter had all the Fats Waller stuff, and we were very impressed with that. I had all these tapes Alan had saved, but now here was the album. Peter had the album. He had loved Fats Waller from a long time ago, and I knew I had gone to the right guy. So I gave Peter the lyrics, and I apologized for how simple the lyrics were, and he said "No no," and he went to work. And when I went there the next time, he sang the song to me, right in front of me, and he had done the organ in the spirit of Fats Waller. He sat on the couch and sang the thing in a falsetto voice, and it was a done deal. He gave it to me and I walked out.
