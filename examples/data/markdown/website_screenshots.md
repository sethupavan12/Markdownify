Image: Hero photo of a small storefront with a peaked roof and a rectangular green sign reading "Jimmy's" mounted above the entrance. The building has a brown shingled fascia with two industrial-style gooseneck lamps hanging over the front. Windows flank the central door, and many leafless deciduous trees fill the background against an overcast sky. The composition centers on the sign and storefront, conveying a small, local business in a quiet, winter-like setting.
