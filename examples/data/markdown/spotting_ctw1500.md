Figure: Photograph of a freestanding roadside memorial sign. The sign is rectangular with a dark green background and a raised gold border and lettering. Centered near the top is a light-blue five-pointed star. Above the star is a round medallion (gold on dark background) bearing a circular emblem and small lettering. The main inscription—“BLUE STAR MEMORIAL”—appears in large gold letters with “BLUE STAR” on the top line and “MEMORIAL” beneath. Below that is the dedication in smaller gold type: “A tribute to the Armed Forces that have defended the United States of America.” Further down, in smaller capital and title-case letters, are sponsorship credits: “SPONSORED BY Just-A-Mere Garden Club IN COOPERATION WITH Sylver’s Corner WOODMEN OF THE WORLD Lodge 1034.” The sign is mounted on a single post set in a grassy lawn; a small tree, residential houses, and a light-colored parked vehicle are visible in the background. The sign’s surfaces show molded lettering and a textured finish; colors are predominantly dark green, gold, and light blue.
