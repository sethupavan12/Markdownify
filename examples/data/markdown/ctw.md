Figure 1 â€” Cropped circular emblem (detailed description)

- Composition: Close-up of the lower-right portion of a circular logo set against a blue background. The image is cropped so only part of the circle and its interior elements are visible.
- Color and contrast: Two-tone scheme of deep blue and white; the blue is the background and interior disc color, white forms a broad circular band and lettering, producing high contrast.
- Typography: The uppercase word "TELEPHONE" appears in bold, sans-serif letters arcing along the lower curve of the white band. Letters are evenly spaced and follow the circular path.
- Central emblem: Within the inner blue disc there is a small, simplified horizontal oval/rounded-rectangle shape with a short triangular element beneath it (visible centrally above the white band). Above that shape, partial uppercase lettering is visible but mostly cropped out.
- Visual details: Edges are crisp; printing appears flat with no visible gradients or shading. The image shows only the right-hand segment of the emblem, so left-side elements and the full circular context are not shown.
