**Figure â€” Refrigerator interior with multiple small yogurt jars**

Alt text: Open refrigerator showing an upper shelf directly under a freezer compartment. The upper shelf is filled across its width with small glass jars with white lids and colorful labels (many read "Toni"); a middle glass shelf below holds three packaged items; two clear crisper drawers are visible at the bottom. Interior light on the right illuminates the contents.

Detailed description:
- Overall scene
  - Refrigerator interior photographed straight-on with freezer compartment (white door) at the very top of the frame.
  - Interior surfaces are white molded plastic; the right side has three molded door shelves (empty) visible in profile.
  - A warm interior light on the right side casts a yellowish glow across the shelves and jars.

- Upper/main shelf (immediately under the freezer)
  - Occupies the central third of the image and is a single glass shelf supported by molded ledges.
  - The shelf is densely populated by small, squat glass jars with white screw lids arranged in multiple rows across the depth and width of the shelf.
  - Many jars bear a blue label with the brand name "Toni" prominently printed; labels include colorful fruit imagery and vary in background color (pink/purple, yellow/cream, light blue).
  - Jar lid tops are mostly white with small printed elements; jars are positioned so labels face forward and are aligned in roughly straight rows.
  - At least one jar on the far right has a distinct orange-yellow label and is slightly separated from the main block of jars.

- Middle shelf (below the jar-filled shelf)
  - A single glass shelf that holds three packaged food items placed side-by-side, centered on the shelf:
    - Left: a red-wrapped bar (rectangular soft pack) lying flat with white lettering visible.
    - Center-left: a narrow blue-wrapped bar with a small cartoon or logo visible at one end.
    - Center-right: a rectangular item wrapped in silver foil with a black-and-colored-striped paper band on top (appears to be a confection or chocolate bar).
    - Right: a vacuum- or plastic-wrapped rectangular block with a beige interior and a red-and-white label on top (likely a packaged cheese or similar).
  - The items are spaced with a small gap between the silver-wrapped product and the beige block.

- Lower area
  - Two clear plastic crisper drawers are visible at the bottom of the image; their fronts are transparent with a slightly frosted top edge.
  - The area between the crisper drawers and the middle shelf is empty except for reflections and the rear interior wall.

- Lighting, reflections, and material notes
  - The glass shelves produce faint reflections of the jars and wrapped items.
  - The warm right-side lamp creates stronger highlights on the jar lids and the right edge of the glass shelf.
  - Plastic molded door shelving at the right shows stepped compartments for bottles or small items; they are currently empty.
