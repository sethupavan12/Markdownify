Figure: Skateboarder on a grassy field

Alt-text: A young man stands outdoors on a large grassy field holding a skateboard vertically by its nose with his left hand and giving a thumbs-up with his right hand. He wears a white ribbed tank top, dark grey/black jeans, and white wraparound sunglasses. His hair is closely cropped. The skateboard he holds is beige/tan with large white block letters "CCS" and a small red star decal; it has yellow wheels and black trucks. To the subject's left (image right) two more skateboard decks lie on the grass — one deck face-down showing black grip tape, the other partially visible with a graphic. The background shows low single-story brick buildings, scattered deciduous trees, a dome-shaped light-colored structure, and a mostly blue sky with some thin clouds. The lighting is bright daylight casting short soft shadows; the photographer’s shadow and the shadow of the subject fall forward in the foreground. The scene is casual and candid, framed from about waist to slightly above the head, with the subject positioned slightly right of center.
