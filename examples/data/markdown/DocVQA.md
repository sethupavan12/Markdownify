# FINDINGS

The findings in this memo reflect comments from both the focus groups as well as the one-on-ones. However, the discussion on packaging will be conclusions drawn from only the focus groups.

## Initial Introduction

Forty percent of these smokers were introduced to VSSS by friends who were smoking (primarily at bars) the cigarette. The cigarette was a conversation piece because it was novel looking--thin and classy thus very feminine. The remaining smokers were introduced to VSSS through magazine ads and store promotions.

Of the total forty two one-on-one interviews, about half initially purchased VSSS and the remaining half bummed cigarettes from friends. The reasons that smokers initially were interested in trying VSSS were because of coupons and promotionals, novelty, catchy packaging and friends offering to share VSSS. None of these smokers said that they initially purchased VSSS because they were seeking a product which offered low smoke.

## Recall of Advertising

Fifty percent were able to recall seeing advertising for VSSS. However, of this fifty percent two thirds said the ads did not convey the message that VSSS were "low smoke." Of those who had not been cued to the low smoke characteristics by advertising, half noticed during trial that VSSS had less smoke coming from the lit end.

## Continuing to Smoke VSSS

Only a couple of the respondents have made VSSS their regular brand. The primary reasons cited for not continuing to smoke VSSS were design differences from their own current brand (too strong or too weak, hard draw, and thinness). Perceptions of weak taste were probably affected by the circumference of the product; prior to trial these smokers perceived that the cigarette would have a weak taste because it was thin. Thinness was seen as a factor which contributed to drawing attention to smoking--not something these smokers want. The thin circumference was also viewed by the majority as too hard to get use to--uncomfortable in their hand and mouth, easily misplaced, and too fragile.
