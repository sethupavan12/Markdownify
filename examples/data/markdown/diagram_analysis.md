Figure: Anatomical diagram of an open human mouth showing teeth and internal oral structures.

Alt-text: Frontal view into a wide-open human mouth. The upper and lower rows of white teeth are visible; pink gums cradle each tooth. The hard palate forms the ridged anterior roof of the mouth, transitioning posteriorly to the smooth, softer soft palate which hangs down slightly toward the throat and bears a small midline uvula. The tongue fills the floor of the mouth, its dorsal surface textured. At the rear on each side of the throat are the tonsillar masses flanking the oropharynx. Labels point to individual teeth (central incisors, lateral incisors, canines, premolars, molars), the labial frenulum at the midline of the upper gum/lip junction, and the oral soft-tissue structures (gum, hard palate, soft palate, uvula, tonsils, tongue, oropharynx).

Labeled structures:
- Gum — the pink mucosal tissue surrounding and supporting the teeth along the upper and lower jaws.
- Hard palate — the anterior, bony, ridged portion of the roof of the mouth, immediately behind the upper front teeth.
- Soft palate — the posterior, flexible muscular portion of the roof of the mouth, posterior to the hard palate.
- Uvula — the small, midline, conical mucosal projection hanging from the posterior edge of the soft palate.
- Tonsils — paired rounded lymphoid tissue masses visible on the lateral walls of the oropharynx toward the rear of the mouth.
- Tongue — the large muscular organ occupying the floor of the mouth, with a textured dorsal surface.
- Labial frenulum — the small mucosal fold connecting the inner surface of the upper lip to the upper gum at the midline.
- Central incisor — the front-most tooth in the dental arch (upper and lower midline incisors).
- Lateral incisor — the tooth immediately adjacent to each central incisor.
- Canine — the pointed tooth located lateral to each lateral incisor (sometimes called cuspids).
- Premolars — the transitional teeth located posterior to the canines and anterior to the molars, typically with two cusps.
- Molars — the broad, posterior grinding teeth at the back of the dental arch.
- Oropharynx — the visible portion of the pharynx at the back of the mouth, posterior to the oral cavity and bounded by the soft palate, tongue base, and tonsillar pillars.
