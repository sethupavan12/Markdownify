Figure: Hardin County road signs â€” detailed description

- Central subject: two vertically stacked rectangular green county road signs mounted on a metal post attached to a wooden utility pole.
  - Top sign: dark green background with white text reading "HARDIN COUNTY" in small caps at the very top, the large numeral "265" centered below it, and the word "ROAD" in smaller white letters at the bottom.
  - Bottom sign: similar design and color, with "HARDIN COUNTY" at top, the large numeral "144" centered, and "ROAD" at the bottom. The bottom sign is slightly rotated relative to the top sign and is positioned directly beneath it on the same mounting assembly.
  - Both signs show typical reflective white lettering on a dark green field; edges of the signs are rounded.

- Supporting elements:
  - A tall wooden utility pole rises behind and slightly to the left of the signs, with multiple electrical cables and guy-wires fanning upward and diagonally across the sky toward the upper left corner of the frame.
  - The signpost and utility pole occupy the left-central foreground of the image; the signs are photographed from slightly below, giving a modest upward perspective.

- Background and environment:
  - A two-lane paved road stretches away from the camera toward the right-center of the image, narrowing into the distance and implying a rural roadway. The road surface appears dark and smooth; no clear lane markings are visible in the immediate foreground.
  - On the right side of the frame, the back (non-reflective side) of an octagonal stop sign is visible, oriented toward traffic coming from the right. The stop sign is unlit and shows its plain grey backside in silhouette.
  - Low, single-story residential buildings and a detached garage or shed sit on the left side of the road in the middle distance. A parked vehicle is visible near one of the buildings.
  - Utility poles and wires continue along the road into the distance, punctuating the roadside at regular intervals.

- Vegetation and seasonality:
  - Deciduous trees with foliage in muted tones line the horizon and flank the road; the colors suggest late autumn (leaves are sparse and tones are brownish/orange).
  - Short grass and low vegetation occupy the immediate roadside areas near the buildings.

- Sky and lighting:
  - The sky fills the upper two-thirds of the image with a dramatic pattern of mid- to high-level clouds (broken stratocumulus/cirrus mix), showing patches of pale blue and areas of warmer light near the horizon.
  - Lighting is soft and diffuse with a warm tint near the horizon, suggesting sunrise or sunset conditions; the signs and pole show even, low-contrast illumination with some shadowing consistent with low-angle light.

- Perspective and composition:
  - The photograph is composed with the sign cluster slightly left of center, creating visual emphasis on the numerals "265" and "144".
  - Leading lines from the road and the row of utility poles draw the eye into the distance to the right.
  - Foreground elements (signs, pole) are in sharp focus; background elements (houses, distant poles) are slightly less detailed due to depth of field and atmospheric perspective.

- Materials and condition:
  - The signs appear in good condition with clear, legible lettering and intact mounting hardware.
  - The wooden utility pole shows natural weathering; metal mounting brackets and fasteners are visible at the sign attachments.

- Notable absence:
  - No people are present in the scene.
  - No visible signage text besides the county and road numbers on the green signs; no commercial signage is apparent.
