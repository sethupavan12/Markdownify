# Pain

Figure: Close-up image of the word "Pain" set in a large, serif typeface with a slight italic slant. The letters are a warm brown-red color against a softly lit, pale yellow-to-cream gradient background. Strong light from the upper-left produces bright highlights on the top edges of the letterforms and casts gentle shadows toward the lower-right. The composition is tightly cropped around the word, showing the full letters "P", "a", "i", "n" with subtle surface texture visible on the background and letter strokes.
