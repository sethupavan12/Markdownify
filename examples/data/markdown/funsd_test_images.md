DECISION TREE ESTIMATION OF TOXIC RISK

Name: J. D. Ergle and R. F. Dufresne  
Date: August 14, 1990

Compound Name: Vanitrope

Structure:
- Figure description (chemical structure, detailed):
  - A six-membered aromatic benzene ring is depicted.
  - One ring carbon bears a hydroxyl group (OH) attached directly to the ring (phenolic OH).
  - An ethoxy substituent is attached to an adjacent ring carbon and is labeled "CH3CH2O" (an oxygen atom connecting a two-carbon ethyl group to the aromatic ring).
  - On another ring carbon, an aliphatic chain of three carbons extends outward; the chain displays a terminal double bond (an allylic/propenyl-type substituent).
  - Overall, the drawing shows an ethoxy-substituted phenol with a prop-2-enyl (allyl) side chain on the aromatic ring.

Estimated Toxicity Class: III

Lorillard Compound Code Number: B134

Comments:
This ethoxy substituted aromatic falls into class III.
