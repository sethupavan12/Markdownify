![Interior of a multi-level shopping mall atrium showing storefronts, railings, shoppers, and ceiling fixtures] 

Figure: Wide-angle view of a shopping mall atrium taken from an upper level walkway. Foreground: a stainless-steel and glass balustrade runs diagonally left-to-right; immediately behind it stands an adult in a maroon short-sleeve uniform jacket with light-coloured trim and an ID badge clipped to the chest pocket, holding items in the right hand. Midground (right): a brightly lit SKECHERS store with a large illuminated blue-and-white "SKECHERS" sign above the entrance; inside the store are shoe displays and at least two shoppers near the doorway. A red diamond-shaped promotional sign near the store entrance displays the numerals "2015". Midground (centre-left): an open multi-tier atrium with multiple balconies and glass railings showing other stores and lit shopfronts on the second and third levels; several shoppers are visible at those balconies. Background and ceiling: recessed ceiling lights and a long white ceiling panel with exposed track-mounted projectors and speakers; the ceiling curves and contains circular downlights. Right edge: a vertical green glossy storefront wall partially visible with reflections. Floor: polished tile reflecting overhead lights. Overall lighting is warm indoor mall illumination; perspective indicates the photographer stood near an escalator or walkway overlooking the central void. Visible textual elements: "SKECHERS" (store sign), "2015" (promotional display).
