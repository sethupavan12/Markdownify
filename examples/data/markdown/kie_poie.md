Figure: Photographed Nutrition Facts label â€” rectangular label with a bold black header reading "Nutrition Facts". Below the header, two small lines show "servings per container 18" (left-aligned) and "Serving size (100g)" (left-aligned). A thick horizontal rule separates the header from the main table. "Amount per serving" appears above a large bold "Calories" with the value "50" prominently to the right. The nutrient list is organized in a single column with nutrient names left-aligned and amounts and % Daily Value aligned to the right; subitems (Saturated Fat, Trans Fat, Dietary Fiber, Total Sugars, Includes Added Sugars) are indented. The label uses black text on a light background; thin divider lines separate groups. Footer small-print contains the % Daily Value explanatory sentence. The photograph is cropped closely to the label edges, showing slight shadowing around the label and a nearly vertical orientation.
