# Accuracy of algorithms on different datasets

Figure: Horizontal grouped bar chart titled "Accuracy of algorithms on different datasets". X-axis labeled "Accuracy" with tick marks at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Y-axis lists four datasets (from bottom to top): "speak", "sorrow", "span", "outset". For each dataset there are three side-by-side horizontal bars representing algorithm performance: orbit (blue), swung (teal/greenish), fusion (olive/green). A legend box below the plot labels the three algorithms. Visual observations and approximate numeric accuracies (read against the 0–10 scale):

- speak: orbit ≈ 4.0, swung ≈ 3.0, fusion ≈ 9.0 (fusion is the highest, nearing 9).
- sorrow: orbit ≈ 1.0, swung ≈ 2.0, fusion ≈ 3.0 (all relatively low; fusion leads).
- span: orbit ≈ 6.0, swung ≈ 3.0–3.5, fusion ≈ 4.0 (orbit leads clearly).
- outset: orbit ≈ 2.0, swung ≈ 1.5–2.0, fusion ≈ 5.5–6.0 (fusion leads moderately).

Table (approximate accuracies):

| Dataset | orbit (blue) | swung (teal) | fusion (olive) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| speak | 4.0 | 3.0 | 9.0 |
| sorrow | 1.0 | 2.0 | 3.0 |
| span | 6.0 | 3.5 | 4.0 |
| outset | 2.0 | 1.5 | 5.5 |
