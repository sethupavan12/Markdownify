norm ergodicity coefficient help to uncover its dependency on the underlying system dynamics.

1.2 Notation

The set of real numbers is denoted by R. The sets of nonnegative integers, nonnegative real numbers are denoted by Z_+, R_+, respectively. We use X to denote finite or countable discrete metric space.

For a vector a and a matrix A, a^T and A^T denote their transposes. For a vector a from space X, we use the following vector norms: `||a||_1 := sum_{x in X} |a(x)|` and `||a||_∞ := max_{x in X} |a(x)|`. For a matrix A from space X × X, we define the following induced operator norms:

`||A||_1 := sup_{x in X: ||x||_1 != 0} ||A x||_1 / ||x||_1 = max_{y in X} sum_{x in X} |A(x,y)|`

and

`||A||_∞ := max_{x in X} sum_{y in X} |A(x,y)|`. We note that `||A^T||_1 = ||A||_∞` and `||A^T||_∞ = ||A||_1`.
