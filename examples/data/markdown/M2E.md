Figure: Photograph of pencil calculations on lined notebook paper.

- Top line: a leftmost digit resembling "8" (the digit is somewhat smudged or written with a small superscript), then a minus sign, then "4 ร ( 9 รท 3 )" written inside parentheses.
- Second line: an equals sign followed by several fractional terms. The clearest visible fraction at the start of this line is "5/8". To the right of that there is a minus sign and another small fraction with a numerator "1" and a denominator that is partly crossed out; cancellation marks (slashes) are drawn through parts of the fraction.
- Third line: continuation of the simplification with more cancellation marks; a small "1/3" appears near the right side of the line as a result of the cancellations.
- Fourth line: an equals sign followed by a heavily crossed-out term (several strokes) and a final small handwritten result that is difficult to read but appears to be a single small fraction (the numerator possibly "1" with an unclear denominator).

Visual details:
- All writing is in pencil on horizontally ruled paper.
- Several cancellation strokes cross through numerators and denominators; some intermediate terms are struck out.
- The handwriting is slanted slightly to the right and the pencil pressure varies, producing faint and darker strokes.
