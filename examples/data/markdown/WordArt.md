Figure: NEWSAGENCY

Alt-text: Large horizontal sign reading "NEWSAGENCY" in uppercase, geometrically styled red block letters with white inner outlines and thin dark outer borders, set against a muted beige background.

Detailed description: A long, narrow rectangular crop showing a single word, NEWSAGENCY, rendered in nine tall, narrow, highly stylized capital letters. Each letter is filled with a solid, deep red color. Immediately inside each red shape is a consistent white outline (approximately 5â€“8% of the letter stroke width) that separates the red fill from a thin, dark outer border (dark brown or nearly black) that defines the letter edges. The letterforms are geometric with straight vertical stems and angular cuts: the N has two vertical strokes joined by a diagonal; the E and A have sharp, blocky crossbars; the W is symmetric with inward angles; the G shows a rectangular opening; the Y ends in a V-shaped fork. Letter spacing is even and justified across the horizontal axis; the word fills the frame width with small margins at left and right. The background is a flat, slightly warm beige with minor unevenness and faint texture suggesting paint or aged material. There are subtle signs of wear and slight surface blemishes (tiny speckles and faint smudging) visible in the background, and minor variations in the red paint saturation near the edges of some letters. Lighting is frontal and even, with no strong shadows except a modest dark outline effect created by the outer border on each letter. The overall impression is of a vintage or retro commercial storefront sign, bold and highly legible.
