Alt text: Poster with the large pink word "BRONSON" at the top, a high‑contrast black-and-white photograph of a man pointing a revolver directly at the viewer, white text "…is in town." above the photo, a torn black banner across the lower third with pink hand‑written style "10 to Midnight", and small distributor/credit text and an "R" rating at the bottom.

Detailed description:
- Overall composition: vertical poster with a wide white margin. Top third dominated by a single large word in pink uppercase letters. Middle third contains a centered black-and-white photographic portrait framed within a white border. Lower third is overlaid by a jagged, torn-paper style black band with a pink, hand-drawn script title. Small production/distributor text and a rating symbol occupy the bottom edge.
- Top typography: the word "BRONSON" set in a bold, condensed sans-serif, uppercase, bright pink, spanning nearly the full width of the poster. Directly beneath and slightly overlapping the top of the photograph is the phrase "...is in town." in white, lowercase letters with an ellipsis prefix; the phrase appears centered and contrasts against the dark upper edge of the photo.
- Photograph: black-and-white, high contrast, grain visible. Portrait orientation: the subject is shown from about mid-torso up, facing the viewer slightly turned to his left. He has short, tousled hair and a thick mustache. Expression is serious, eyes narrowed. Right arm (viewer left) is extended straight toward the viewer, holding a revolver pointed directly forward; the barrel of the gun is visually centered and prominent. Clothing appears to be a collared shirt or jacket and a sweater or scarf layered beneath — mid-tones and highlights create sculpted facial shadows.
- Title band and main title: across the lower third a black torn-edge banner stretches horizontally. On this band, a bright pink, stylized, brush-script reads "10 to Midnight" — the numerals and words are roughly hand-painted, with irregular edges and dynamic stroke width. The black band has white jagged edges suggesting torn paper or paint.
- Bottom credits and details: below the black title band, centered near the poster bottom, is a small white distributor/studio block with a circular or hexagonal mark (logo) and a line of tiny production/distributor text. At the very bottom right corner there is a small "R" rating symbol inside a rounded square or circle. A thin white border surrounds the entire image, leaving a narrow white margin.

- BRONSON
- …is in town.
