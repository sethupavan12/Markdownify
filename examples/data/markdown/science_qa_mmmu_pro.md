## p-V diagram

- Axes:
  - Vertical axis labeled "p(atm)" with tick marks at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (atm).
  - Horizontal axis labeled "V(L)" with tick marks at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (L).
  - Origin at the lower-left corner (0,0).

- Points:
  - a: located at V = 1 L, p = 4 atm; marked by a filled point and labeled "a".
  - b: located at V = 4 L, p = 2 atm; marked by a filled point and labeled "b".

- Process path:
  - A straight-line segment connects point a to point b, sloping downwards (pressure decreases as volume increases).
  - An arrow on the segment indicates the direction from a toward b.

- Guide/dimension lines:
  - A horizontal dashed line at p = 4 atm from the vertical axis to point a.
  - A horizontal dashed line at p = 2 atm from the vertical axis to point b.
  - A vertical dashed line from point a down to V = 1 L on the V-axis.
  - A vertical dashed line from point b down to V = 4 L on the V-axis.

- Notes on appearance:
  - Axes and the aâ†’b line are solid; dashed lines are used only for the horizontal and vertical guides to indicate the coordinates of points a and b.
