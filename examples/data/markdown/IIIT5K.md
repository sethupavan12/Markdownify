![DAWN logo â€” red stylized uppercase letters "DAWN" centered on a black background]

Figure: A bold, red, all-caps stylized word "DAWN" set against a solid black rectangular field. The letters are heavy, geometric block forms with sharp angular cuts. From left to right: the "D" has a full-height vertical stem on the left and a rounded right counter flattened into a straight diagonal edge; the "A" is rendered without a horizontal crossbar, formed by two slanted outer strokes that meet at a pointed apex, with a black triangular negative space forming the interior opening; the "W" is composed of four strokes creating two downward-facing points, the inner vertex extending lower than the outer bases; the "N" comprises two near-vertical strokes joined by a steep diagonal. Letterforms are tightly kerned and nearly touch one another; their bottoms align on a common baseline while tops show varying angular cuts that give a compressed, dynamic look. The red fill is uniformly solid with no gradients or texture, producing high contrast against the black background. The composition is centered horizontally within the rectangular band, occupying most of the available vertical space.
