LEAF PARTS

Figure (detailed description): A colored diagram of a simple broad leaf attached to a vertical stem on the left. The leaf blade is heart/oval-shaped, filled with bright green and outlined in a darker green. Multiple primary and secondary veins are drawn as thin darker-green lines branching across the blade from the central midrib. The leaf tapers to a pointed tip at the right. A narrow stalk (petiole) connects the leaf base to the stem. At the junction where the petiole meets the stem there is a small, triangular/leaf-like structure (stipule) and the angle formed between the stem and the petiole is indicated (axil). Labels in the diagram point to the following parts.

Labels:
- Vein — the thin branching lines visible across the blade.
- Tip — the pointed apex of the blade at the right.
- Blade — the flattened, expanded green surface of the leaf.
- Petiole — the stalk connecting the blade to the stem.
- Axil — the angle/area between the stem and the petiole.
- Stipule — the small appendage at the base of the petiole near the stem.
