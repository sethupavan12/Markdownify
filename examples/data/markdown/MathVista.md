Description:
- Chart type: Scatter plot with two data series (healthcare and research & development).
- Title text (large, at top): "What is the difference between two consecutive major ticks on the Y-axis ?"
- Subtitle (small, above plot area): "Total expenditure of government of Greece in healthcare and R&D projects"
- X-axis:
  - Label: "Year"
  - Visible tick labels: 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001

Visual details:
- Health series (pink/magenta circles) plotted near the top of the plot area around the 9–10 tick for years 1995–1999, a visibly lower point near 8 for 2000, and a point slightly below 10 for 2001.
- Research and Development series (teal/green circles) plotted close to the x-axis, around the 0–1 range across the years 1995–2001.
- Gridlines: horizontal gridlines align with the major Y-axis ticks (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).
- Plot area: wide horizontal layout with x-axis tick labels rotated slightly (vertical orientation) and minimal axis tick formatting beyond the numeric labels.
