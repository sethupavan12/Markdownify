# Germans: Majority Prefer Strong Ties with U.S.

Which is more important for Germany — to have strong ties with the U.S. or strong ties with Russia?

Figure — Pie chart showing responses:
- The chart is a circle divided into four wedges. The largest wedge, about 57% of the circle and colored a darker olive-green, is labeled "Strong ties with U.S. 57%." A roughly one-fifth wedge, about 21% and a lighter olive tone, is labeled "Equally close ties (VOL) 21%." A smaller wedge, about 15% and an even lighter green, is labeled "Strong ties with Russia 15%." The smallest wedge, about 7% and the palest shade, is labeled "Don't know 7%." Labels are placed adjacent to or within each wedge.

Data table:
| Response | Percentage |
|---|---:|
| Strong ties with U.S. | 57% |
| Equally close ties (VOL) | 21% |
| Strong ties with Russia | 15% |
| Don't know | 7% |

# Accuracy of algorithms on different datasets

Figure: Horizontal grouped bar chart titled "Accuracy of algorithms on different datasets". X-axis labeled "Accuracy" with tick marks at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Y-axis lists four datasets (from bottom to top): "speak", "sorrow", "span", "outset". For each dataset there are three side-by-side horizontal bars representing algorithm performance: orbit (blue), swung (teal/greenish), fusion (olive/green). A legend box below the plot labels the three algorithms. Visual observations and approximate numeric accuracies (read against the 0–10 scale):

- speak: orbit ≈ 4.0, swung ≈ 3.0, fusion ≈ 9.0 (fusion is the highest, nearing 9).
- sorrow: orbit ≈ 1.0, swung ≈ 2.0, fusion ≈ 3.0 (all relatively low; fusion leads).
- span: orbit ≈ 6.0, swung ≈ 3.0–3.5, fusion ≈ 4.0 (orbit leads clearly).
- outset: orbit ≈ 2.0, swung ≈ 1.5–2.0, fusion ≈ 5.5–6.0 (fusion leads moderately).

Table (approximate accuracies):

| Dataset | orbit (blue) | swung (teal) | fusion (olive) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| speak | 4.0 | 3.0 | 9.0 |

1.2 Notation

The set of real numbers is denoted by R. The sets of nonnegative integers, nonnegative real numbers are denoted by Z_+, R_+, respectively. We use X to denote finite or countable discrete metric space.

For a vector a and a matrix A, a^T and A^T denote their transposes. For a vector a from space X, we use the following vector norms: `||a||_1 := sum_{x in X} |a(x)|` and `||a||_∞ := max_{x in X} |a(x)|`. For a matrix A from space X × X, we define the following induced operator norms:

`||A||_1 := sup_{x in X: ||x||_1 != 0} ||A x||_1 / ||x||_1 = max_{y in X} sum_{x in X} |A(x,y)|`

and

`||A||_∞ := max_{x in X} sum_{y in X} |A(x,y)|`. We note that `||A^T||_1 = ||A||_∞` and `||A^T||_∞ = ||A||_1`.

# FINDINGS

The findings in this memo reflect comments from both the focus groups as well as the one-on-ones. However, the discussion on packaging will be conclusions drawn from only the focus groups.

## Initial Introduction

Forty percent of these smokers were introduced to VSSS by friends who were smoking (primarily at bars) the cigarette. The cigarette was a conversation piece because it was novel looking--thin and classy thus very feminine. The remaining smokers were introduced to VSSS through magazine ads and store promotions.

Of the total forty two one-on-one interviews, about half initially purchased VSSS and the remaining half bummed cigarettes from friends. The reasons that smokers initially were interested in trying VSSS were because of coupons and promotionals, novelty, catchy packaging and friends offering to share VSSS. None of these smokers said that they initially purchased VSSS because they were seeking a product which offered low smoke.

## Recall of Advertising

Fifty percent were able to recall seeing advertising for VSSS. However, of this fifty percent two thirds said the ads did not convey the message that VSSS were "low smoke." Of those who had not been cued to the low smoke characteristics by advertising, half noticed during trial that VSSS had less smoke coming from the lit end.

## Continuing to Smoke VSSS

Only a couple of the respondents have made VSSS their regular brand. The primary reasons cited for not continuing to smoke VSSS were design differences from their own current brand (too strong or too weak, hard draw, and thinness). Perceptions of weak taste were probably affected by the circumference of the product; prior to trial these smokers perceived that the cigarette would have a weak taste because it was thin. Thinness was seen as a factor which contributed to drawing attention to smoking--not something these smokers want. The thin circumference was also viewed by the majority as too hard to get use to--uncomfortable in their hand and mouth, easily misplaced, and too fragile.

and activities of its adherents. Moreover, there were many practical difficulties to be met in implementing any general principles relating to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.

109. Another view was that the difficulties stemmed from the fact that conditions concerning religion in different States varied in the extreme: in every State there were to be found not only followers of numerous religions or beliefs, among whom there were conflicting convictions, but also atheists, who maintained non-religious convictions. While religion had a sacred character for its followers, those who held non-religious beliefs were equally entitled to maintain their beliefs and to be protected against discrimination, since to them their convictions were no less sacred. It was thus necessary to establish a balance between those who professed a religion and those who did not. According to this view there could be no freedom of conscience in a State in which adherents of one religion or belief held a privileged position and there was discrimination against adherents of other religions or beliefs. Nor could there be freedom of conscience in a State in which there was discrimination against persons holding atheistic views. Separation of the Church and the State, and of the Church and the schools, was an essential guarantee of freedom of conscience. Where religion or belief was bound to the State, either officially or by ties of an ideological or economic nature, it was merely a weapon to be used by the State in carrying out its policy.

110. Members generally agreed that the Commission should not attempt to examine theoretical religious concepts, but should concentrate upon the elaboration of practical rules for freedom of religion and other beliefs which could be universally supported.

111. There was considerable discussion in the Commission of the meaning to be attributed to the word "belief", as used in the draft principles prepared by the Sub-Commission. Reference was made to the fact that in the footnote on page 1 of his Study of Discrimination in the Matter of Religious Rights and Practices Mr. Krishnaswami had stated that "In view of the difficulty of defining 'religion', the term 'religion or belief' is used ... to include, in addition to various theistic creeds, such other beliefs as agnosticism, free thought, atheism and rationalism". During the discussion some members pointed out that the footnote expressed only the personal point of view of the Special Rapporteur and had no special significance. Other members supported the definition of the words "religion or belief" given in Mr. Krishnaswami's study. They pointed out that the use of these two words in the document to be drawn up would ensure freedom and non-discrimination both with respect to persons professing a religion and with respect to persons adhering to atheistic beliefs. It was also recalled that the term "religion or belief" had been used both in article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in article 18 of the draft Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

112. In the view of some members the use of the term "religion or belief" to include not only those who

followed a religion but also those who held non-religious ethical beliefs was wrong in principle because it gave the impression that the two were equivalent, which was not so. In their opinion religion was much more than private prayers or public worship; it was at the basis of the whole conception of life of a religious man, permeating his thinking and his deeds in relation to his Creator, and having a profound influence upon other aspects of his life as an individual and in his bearing towards other people and towards society as a whole. They also stated that because of its unique and transcendant character and its comprehensive and pervasive nature, religion could not, in principle, be put on the same footing with agnosticism, free-thought, atheism and rationalism. On the other hand, it was pointed out that it was absurd to attempt to place religion above atheistic belief.

113. Other members, while recognizing the importance of distinguishing between religion and belief where individuals were concerned, were of the opinion that from the point of view of the State that distinction was irrelevant: the State should show the same tolerance with regard to both religion and non-religious beliefs although it should not permit freedom to be invoked to protect those who wished to attack and destroy religion. In their external manifestations, religious and non-religious beliefs should be respected equally. It was pointed out also that the Sub-Commission clearly had intended the draft principles to prohibit all discrimination in matters of belief, whether religious or non-religious, as evidenced by the fact that it had used the expression "religion or belief" no less than twenty-three times, as well as by its enunciation, in paragraph 1 of part I of the draft principles, of the right of everyone to adhere or not to adhere to a religion or belief.

114. Several members strongly favoured the use of the term "religion or belief" throughout the principles, both as a matter of consistency and because the term "non-religious belief" might be interpreted as including political or other secular beliefs. In the opinion of others, the absence of the word "religion" made no difference, as the word "belief" should be interpreted in the broadest possible sense. One member felt that there was no need for the use systematically of the term "religion or belief" and in particular of the term "or belief" in certain of the draft principles, such as those having application exclusively to priests or ministers of religion.

115. Another issue which arose in the course of the general debate was that of the individual and social characteristics of religion. One view was that the draft principles were seriously defective in that they stressed mainly the freedom of the individual and did not adequately protect the rights of religious groups as such. It was maintained that the religious rights of individuals could not be guaranteed to the fullest extent unless the community character of religion was taken into account and the rights resulting therefrom were also guaranteed; such rights included, for example, the right of a religious community to organize its adherents in groups, the right of its central authorities to give directives of a binding nature on matters of

![DAWN logo — red stylized uppercase letters "DAWN" centered on a black background]

Figure: A bold, red, all-caps stylized word "DAWN" set against a solid black rectangular field. The letters are heavy, geometric block forms with sharp angular cuts. From left to right: the "D" has a full-height vertical stem on the left and a rounded right counter flattened into a straight diagonal edge; the "A" is rendered without a horizontal crossbar, formed by two slanted outer strokes that meet at a pointed apex, with a black triangular negative space forming the interior opening; the "W" is composed of four strokes creating two downward-facing points, the inner vertex extending lower than the outer bases; the "N" comprises two near-vertical strokes joined by a steep diagonal. Letterforms are tightly kerned and nearly touch one another; their bottoms align on a common baseline while tops show varying angular cuts that give a compressed, dynamic look. The red fill is uniformly solid with no gradients or texture, producing high contrast against the black background. The composition is centered horizontally within the rectangular band, occupying most of the available vertical space.

Figure: Photograph of pencil calculations on lined notebook paper.

- Top line: a leftmost digit resembling "8" (the digit is somewhat smudged or written with a small superscript), then a minus sign, then "4 × ( 9 ÷ 3 )" written inside parentheses.
- Second line: an equals sign followed by several fractional terms. The clearest visible fraction at the start of this line is "5/8". To the right of that there is a minus sign and another small fraction with a numerator "1" and a denominator that is partly crossed out; cancellation marks (slashes) are drawn through parts of the fraction.
- Third line: continuation of the simplification with more cancellation marks; a small "1/3" appears near the right side of the line as a result of the cancellations.
- Fourth line: an equals sign followed by a heavily crossed-out term (several strokes) and a final small handwritten result that is difficult to read but appears to be a single small fraction (the numerator possibly "1" with an unclear denominator).

Visual details:
- All writing is in pencil on horizontally ruled paper.
- Several cancellation strokes cross through numerators and denominators; some intermediate terms are struck out.
- The handwriting is slanted slightly to the right and the pencil pressure varies, producing faint and darker strokes.

Answer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.

- A. 120°
- B. 130°
- C. 140°
- D. 150°

Figure (detailed description):
- A horizontal line labeled AB at the top, with point A at the left end and point B at the right end.
- A second horizontal line labeled EF at the bottom, with point E at the left and point F at the right; point D lies on EF between E and F.
- The two horizontal lines AB and EF are parallel (AB ∥ EF).
- From point A a slanted segment descends to the right and meets point C; the angle between AB (to the right from A) and this slanted segment at A is marked 50° (the 50° label is on the interior between the slanted segment and the top horizontal line).
- At point C the slanted segment bends into a vertical segment that goes straight down to point D on EF.
- At point D there is a small square marking a right angle between the vertical segment CD and the bottom horizontal line EF (so CD ⟂ EF).
- Points roughly positioned: A at upper-left, B at upper-right, slanted segment from A down-right to C, vertical down from C to D on the lower horizontal EF.

Image description — detailed visual transcription and scene description:

A close-up photograph of two large plastic laundry product containers placed on a quilted floral mattress cover. The right container is white with a predominantly pink and purple product label; the left container (partially visible) is bright yellow and appears to be a second plastic jug positioned in the foreground, occupying the left third of the frame and obscuring part of the white container. The white container's label shows three rolled towels (cream, beige, and light gray) arranged diagonally near the top-left of the label area, with small stylized white and pink flowers scattered around them. In the upper-right of the label is an orange square with the brand name rendered as "BiG" (stylized with a lowercase "i") in white, and the word "VALUE" in white beneath it.

Across the lower-middle of the label is a curved purple banner with yellow uppercase text reading "PELEMBUT PAKAIAN" (the yellow text has a slight drop shadow). Immediately after that phrase on the purple banner, in smaller yellow/white mixed text, is "Fabric Softener" and below that in a cursive white script is "Floral Fresh". In the lower-right corner of the label is a small blue ribbon-shaped badge containing the white text "5L" indicating volume. Above that badge, on the label, the bilingual net content phrasing appears as "Net Content / Kandungan Bersih" (small print). The mattress beneath the jugs is quilted white with a repeating floral print in muted greens, pinks, and yellows; the photo lighting comes from a flash or bright direct light, creating specular highlights on the yellow jug and some shadow beneath the containers. The image is tightly cropped: edges of both jugs are cut off by the frame.

Transcribed visible text (preserving visual casing and order as seen):

- BiG VALUE
- PELEMBUT PAKAIAN Fabric Softener
- Floral Fresh
- Net Content / Kandungan Bersih
- 5L

The image is shown on a white background.]

### WordArt

Figure: NEWSAGENCY

Alt-text: Large horizontal sign reading "NEWSAGENCY" in uppercase, geometrically styled red block letters with white inner outlines and thin dark outer borders, set against a muted beige background.

Detailed description: A long, narrow rectangular crop showing a single word, NEWSAGENCY, rendered in nine tall, narrow, highly stylized capital letters. Each letter is filled with a solid, deep red color. Immediately inside each red shape is a consistent white outline (approximately 5–8% of the letter stroke width) that separates the red fill from a thin, dark outer border (dark brown or nearly black) that defines the letter edges. The letterforms are geometric with straight vertical stems and angular cuts: the N has two vertical strokes joined by a diagonal; the E and A have sharp, blocky crossbars; the W is symmetric with inward angles; the G shows a rectangular opening; the Y ends in a V-shaped fork. Letter spacing is even and justified across the horizontal axis; the word fills the frame width with small margins at left and right. The background is a flat, slightly warm beige with minor unevenness and faint texture suggesting paint or aged material. There are subtle signs of wear and slight surface blemishes (tiny speckles and faint smudging) visible in the background, and minor variations in the red paint saturation near the edges of some letters. Lighting is frontal and even, with no strong shadows except a modest dark outline effect created by the outer border on each letter. The overall impression is of a vintage or retro commercial storefront sign, bold and highly legible.

Figure 1 — Cropped circular emblem (detailed description)

- Composition: Close-up of the lower-right portion of a circular logo set against a blue background. The image is cropped so only part of the circle and its interior elements are visible.
- Color and contrast: Two-tone scheme of deep blue and white; the blue is the background and interior disc color, white forms a broad circular band and lettering, producing high contrast.
- Typography: The uppercase word "TELEPHONE" appears in bold, sans-serif letters arcing along the lower curve of the white band. Letters are evenly spaced and follow the circular path.
- Central emblem: Within the inner blue disc there is a small, simplified horizontal oval/rounded-rectangle shape with a short triangular element beneath it (visible centrally above the white band). Above that shape, partial uppercase lettering is visible but mostly cropped out.
- Visual details: Edges are crisp; printing appears flat with no visible gradients or shading. The image shows only the right-hand segment of the emblem, so left-side elements and the full circular context are not shown.

The tongue fills the floor of the mouth, its dorsal surface textured. At the rear on each side of the throat are the tonsillar masses flanking the oropharynx. Labels point to individual teeth (central incisors, lateral incisors, canines, premolars, molars), the labial frenulum at the midline of the upper gum/lip junction, and the oral soft-tissue structures (gum, hard palate, soft palate, uvula, tonsils, tongue, oropharynx).

Labeled structures:
- Gum — the pink mucosal tissue surrounding and supporting the teeth along the upper and lower jaws.
- Hard palate — the anterior, bony, ridged portion of the roof of the mouth, immediately behind the upper front teeth.
- Soft palate — the posterior, flexible muscular portion of the roof of the mouth, posterior to the hard palate.
- Uvula — the small, midline, conical mucosal projection hanging from the posterior edge of the soft palate.
- Tonsils — paired rounded lymphoid tissue masses visible on the lateral walls of the oropharynx toward the rear of the mouth.
- Tongue — the large muscular organ occupying the floor of the mouth, with a textured dorsal surface.
- Labial frenulum — the small mucosal fold connecting the inner surface of the upper lip to the upper gum at the midline.
- Central incisor — the front-most tooth in the dental arch (upper and lower midline incisors).
- Lateral incisor — the tooth immediately adjacent to each central incisor.
- Canine — the pointed tooth located lateral to each lateral incisor (sometimes called cuspids).
- Premolars — the transitional teeth located posterior to the canines and anterior to the molars, typically with two cusps.
- Molars — the broad, posterior grinding teeth at the back of the dental arch.
- Oropharynx — the visible portion of the pharynx at the back of the mouth, posterior to the oral cavity and bounded by the soft palate, tongue base, and tonsillar pillars.

LEAF PARTS

Figure (detailed description): A colored diagram of a simple broad leaf attached to a vertical stem on the left. The leaf blade is heart/oval-shaped, filled with bright green and outlined in a darker green. Multiple primary and secondary veins are drawn as thin darker-green lines branching across the blade from the central midrib. The leaf tapers to a pointed tip at the right. A narrow stalk (petiole) connects the leaf base to the stem. At the junction where the petiole meets the stem there is a small, triangular/leaf-like structure (stipule) and the angle formed between the stem and the petiole is indicated (axil). Labels in the diagram point to the following parts.

Labels:
- Vein — the thin branching lines visible across the blade.
- Tip — the pointed apex of the blade at the right.
- Blade — the flattened, expanded green surface of the leaf.
- Petiole — the stalk connecting the blade to the stem.
- Axil — the angle/area between the stem and the petiole.
- Stipule — the small appendage at the base of the petiole near the stem.

KING

A COMICS BIOGRAPHY

THE SPECIAL EDITION

by HO CHE ANDERSON

Figure — Cover illustration (detailed): A full-page painted portrait occupying the lower three-quarters of the page, showing a man in three-quarter profile turned to the viewer’s right, captured mid-speech with mouth open and visible teeth. He wears a dark suit jacket, a white dress shirt with a pointed collar, and a solid dark tie. A cluster of vintage-style broadcast microphones is visible near his chest at the lower right of the portrait. To the right edge of the image is a large, partially visible flag with a blue field containing indistinct white star-like shapes and a red-and-white triangular stripe at the bottom-right corner. The background behind the man consists of pale, large rectangular stone blocks or columns rendered with painterly brushstrokes. Across the top quarter of the page is a wide black horizontal band containing the single word “KING” in very large, muted-gray uppercase serif letters that span most of the band’s width. Centered beneath the band and above the portrait are the lines “A COMICS BIOGRAPHY” (small caps serif), then “THE SPECIAL EDITION” (larger serif, underlined in the original), and below that the byline “by HO CHE ANDERSON” in small caps. The overall color palette is cool and muted with strong contrast between the dark band, the mid-tone painted portrait, and the bright white margins framing the page; visible brush texture and painterly shading convey a hand-painted, illustrative style.

### movie_poster

Alt text: Poster with the large pink word "BRONSON" at the top, a high‑contrast black-and-white photograph of a man pointing a revolver directly at the viewer, white text "…is in town." above the photo, a torn black banner across the lower third with pink hand‑written style "10 to Midnight", and small distributor/credit text and an "R" rating at the bottom.

Detailed description:
- Overall composition: vertical poster with a wide white margin. Top third dominated by a single large word in pink uppercase letters. Middle third contains a centered black-and-white photographic portrait framed within a white border. Lower third is overlaid by a jagged, torn-paper style black band with a pink, hand-drawn script title. Small production/distributor text and a rating symbol occupy the bottom edge.
- Top typography: the word "BRONSON" set in a bold, condensed sans-serif, uppercase, bright pink, spanning nearly the full width of the poster. Directly beneath and slightly overlapping the top of the photograph is the phrase "...is in town." in white, lowercase letters with an ellipsis prefix; the phrase appears centered and contrasts against the dark upper edge of the photo.
- Photograph: black-and-white, high contrast, grain visible. Portrait orientation: the subject is shown from about mid-torso up, facing the viewer slightly turned to his left. He has short, tousled hair and a thick mustache. Expression is serious, eyes narrowed. Right arm (viewer left) is extended straight toward the viewer, holding a revolver pointed directly forward; the barrel of the gun is visually centered and prominent. Clothing appears to be a collared shirt or jacket and a sweater or scarf layered beneath — mid-tones and highlights create sculpted facial shadows.
- Title band and main title: across the lower third a black torn-edge banner stretches horizontally. On this band, a bright pink, stylized, brush-script reads "10 to Midnight" — the numerals and words are roughly hand-painted, with irregular edges and dynamic stroke width. The black band has white jagged edges suggesting torn paper or paint.
- Bottom credits and details: below the black title band, centered near the poster bottom, is a small white distributor/studio block with a circular or hexagonal mark (logo) and a line of tiny production/distributor text. At the very bottom right corner there is a small "R" rating symbol inside a rounded square or circle. A thin white border surrounds the entire image, leaving a narrow white margin.

Text visible on the poster (verbatim lines as printed, in reading order):
- BRONSON
- …is in town.
- 10 to Midnight
- From Cannon Releasing
- (small block of production/credit text along the bottom; individual names/details not legible at this resolution)
- R

to promote tissue regeneration in case of superficial burn injury but also to have antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and antioxidant effects [44]. The presence of flavonoids in the extracts indicates their potentiality to reduce in vitro cholesterol agents and to induce an antifungal activity [44, 45]. Flavonoids are known to inhibit α-amylase activity which regulates the amount of glucose in the blood; therefore the extracts of C. nitida can be used as an antidiabetic. The presence of flavonoids and saponins has earlier been reported in 2009 by N'Guessan et al. [46] in Côte d'Ivoire during their work on the same plants. Nevertheless, we observed in our study the absence of triterpene and steroid and the presence of tannins whereas triterpene and steroid were observed without tannins in the same organ of the plant [46] and the other parts of the same plant [13, 47]. These observations may be probably due, in the case of the same organ, to the collection conditions such as origin of the plants, the conditions, and the periods of harvesting organs. We should notice that the environment may influence the synthesis and expression of phytochemical components in the plant [48–52]. Some plant physiologists went further saying that plants components can be produced only at a certain time and/or in a determined condition. For the same plant species, there is an unequal distribution of secondary metabolites through the organs.

Among the ten reference strains, at the unique concentration of 20 mg/mL, the ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts have inhibited the growth of yeast and Gram + and Gram − bacteria (Table 2). An antimicrobial effect was not observed on E. coli at the used concentration. This observation on the susceptibility of E. coli is different from those observed in 2011 by Indabawa and Arazai [53] during their study on the antibacterial activity on the seed of C. nitida. Indeed, those authors found that C. nitida's seed aqueous extract inhibits the growth of E. coli at the concentration of 500 μg/mL. That difference can be explained by the fact that we do not use the same organs.

Concerning the meat isolated Staphylococcus strains, our results indicate that the solvent plays a role in the extraction of active principles (Figure 1). The ethanol extracts are less effective than ethyl acetate extracts (P = 0.028) on meat isolated Staphylococcus strains. These results are similar to those of Bolou et al. [54] obtained during their study on Terminalia glaucasccens when they demonstrated that the ethyl acetate extract was more effective than the ethanol extract at the same dose on certain microorganisms. The possible explanation to the difference of activity between the two extracts may be the ability of solvent to solubilize and extract some phytomolecules. Thus, according to Cowan [55], during the liquid-liquid extraction, phytomolecules are distributed between the solvents according to their polarity and solubility. It can be thus concluded that the active antimicrobial compounds contained in the bark of C. nitida are more soluble in the ethyl acetate solvent than ethanol one. The active antistaphylococcal principles contained in the bark of C. nitida are more concentrate by ethyl acetate.

Analyzing Figure 2, it appears that the inhibition zone diameters were not significantly different independently of the extract solvent regardless of duration (24 h and 48 h) on both reference (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)) and food isolated strains (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)). Our results are different from those of Arekemase et al. [56] in their study when they observed a significant difference of inhibition diameters in the time. We can notice that Arekemase et al. [56] used 10 times higher concentration to the one we used; that may thus be one of the reasons. Indeed, with the highest concentration, it is possible to have an increase of the inhibition diameter because the active antimicrobial substance is in excess.

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was variable depending on the strains and extracts (Table 3). Our found concentrations were higher than those reported by

## Internship Application Flowchart

Figure: Flowchart showing the internship application process, arranged vertically from top to bottom. At the very top is an oval labeled "Start". A downward arrow leads to a rectangular box centered below labeled "Research Suitable Internship Opportunities". From that box a left-leaning arrow goes to a rectangular box labeled "Prepare Your Application", which in turn leads down to "Reach Out for Recommendations", then to "Submit the Application". From "Submit the Application" a downward arrow goes to a diamond labeled "Got Response?". The diamond has two outputs:
- The left/lower output labeled "Yes" goes downward to a rectangular box "Prepare for Interview", then downward to another diamond "Got Internship?". That diamond has two outputs:
  - The left output (when Yes) goes to a rectangular box "Accept Offer and Prepare", then down to an oval "End".
  - The right output (when No) goes to a rectangular box "Ask for Feedback and Continue Applying". From that box an upward vertical arrow labeled "Continue" returns to "Research Suitable Internship Opportunities".
- The right/upward output from "Got Response?" labeled "No" follows a curved arrow returning to "Research Suitable Internship Opportunities".

Layout details: the main upward return path from both "Got Response? -> No" and "Ask for Feedback and Continue Applying -> Continue" feed back into the single "Research Suitable Internship Opportunities" box at the center top of the flow. The flow uses standard process symbols: ovals for Start/End, rectangles for process steps, diamonds for decision points; arrows indicate direction and labeled Yes/No outcomes on decision branches.

## Skill
Understand overall supply and demand

## Lecture
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.

| Change | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand |
|---|---|---|---|
| Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up |
| Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down |

Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.

It might have been 1974. I was using [bluesman] Fats Waller in my film Eraserhead, and I had written lyrics for a song called "In Heaven," and I needed the music for that, and I needed a girl to sing that. So I ended up at Peter Ivers' house with my friend (and Eraserhead sound designer) Alan Splet, and lo and behold, he saw a [Fats Waller] album, and he thought the album was out of print and completely rare, but Peter had all the Fats Waller stuff, and we were very impressed with that. I had all these tapes Alan had saved, but now here was the album. Peter had the album. He had loved Fats Waller from a long time ago, and I knew I had gone to the right guy. So I gave Peter the lyrics, and I apologized for how simple the lyrics were, and he said "No no," and he went to work. And when I went there the next time, he sang the song to me, right in front of me, and he had done the organ in the spirit of Fats Waller. He sat on the couch and sang the thing in a falsetto voice, and it was a done deal. He gave it to me and I walked out.

![Interior of a multi-level shopping mall atrium showing storefronts, railings, shoppers, and ceiling fixtures] 

Figure: Wide-angle view of a shopping mall atrium taken from an upper level walkway. Foreground: a stainless-steel and glass balustrade runs diagonally left-to-right; immediately behind it stands an adult in a maroon short-sleeve uniform jacket with light-coloured trim and an ID badge clipped to the chest pocket, holding items in the right hand. Midground (right): a brightly lit SKECHERS store with a large illuminated blue-and-white "SKECHERS" sign above the entrance; inside the store are shoe displays and at least two shoppers near the doorway. A red diamond-shaped promotional sign near the store entrance displays the numerals "2015". Midground (centre-left): an open multi-tier atrium with multiple balconies and glass railings showing other stores and lit shopfronts on the second and third levels; several shoppers are visible at those balconies. Background and ceiling: recessed ceiling lights and a long white ceiling panel with exposed track-mounted projectors and speakers; the ceiling curves and contains circular downlights. Right edge: a vertical green glossy storefront wall partially visible with reflections. Floor: polished tile reflecting overhead lights. Overall lighting is warm indoor mall illumination; perspective indicates the photographer stood near an escalator or walkway overlooking the central void. Visible textual elements: "SKECHERS" (store sign), "2015" (promotional display).

Figure: Skateboarder on a grassy field

Alt-text: A young man stands outdoors on a large grassy field holding a skateboard vertically by its nose with his left hand and giving a thumbs-up with his right hand. He wears a white ribbed tank top, dark grey/black jeans, and white wraparound sunglasses. His hair is closely cropped. The skateboard he holds is beige/tan with large white block letters "CCS" and a small red star decal; it has yellow wheels and black trucks. To the subject's left (image right) two more skateboard decks lie on the grass — one deck face-down showing black grip tape, the other partially visible with a graphic. The background shows low single-story brick buildings, scattered deciduous trees, a dome-shaped light-colored structure, and a mostly blue sky with some thin clouds. The lighting is bright daylight casting short soft shadows; the photographer’s shadow and the shadow of the subject fall forward in the foreground. The scene is casual and candid, framed from about waist to slightly above the head, with the subject positioned slightly right of center.

Figure: Outdoor netball match — several players contesting a shot as the orange ball approaches the rim.

Alt-text / detailed caption:
- Composition: Vertical photograph of an outdoor netball court captured during play. The frame centers on the goal post and the immediate cluster of players underneath and around the ring. The ball (orange) is captured just above or entering the metal rim and white net. The court surface is blue with white and yellow boundary/marking lines visible.
- Players and clothing: A group of players wearing colored bibs over long-sleeved tops and long trousers. One central player wears a yellow bib with large navy letters "GO" and is reaching upward with both hands; the same bib shows a small manufacturer mark beneath the letters. Several other players wear red bibs with large black letters visible: "GS", "C", and "GA". Some players wear light-coloured head coverings/scarves and long sleeves; footwear includes athletic shoes in various colours (notably white with pink accents, pink, and black).
- Action and posture: The central "GO" player stands directly beneath the hoop with arms raised and gaze directed upward. Players in red bibs surround her, some reaching toward the ball and others positioned to defend or rebound. Body language indicates an active contest for the shot or rebound.
- Court infrastructure and surroundings: The goal post is a white metal pole anchored at the base with visible ropes and weighted sandbags/cloth sacks and rectangular bricks used as ballast. A tall chain-link fence with vertical support poles encloses the court; beyond the fence are trees, low vegetation, and parked vehicles partly visible. Tall floodlight poles and streetlight posts rise behind the fence. Orange plastic traffic/divider barriers appear in the background at left.
- Lighting and weather: Daylight scene with a bright but slightly overcast sky; no strong shadows, indicating diffused sunlight.
- Small textual elements visible in the image: large bib letters "GO", "GS", "C", "GA"; a small manufacturer/brand mark beneath "GO"; a small white multi-word watermark in capital letters located at the bottom-right corner of the frame (content not transcribed).
- Notable equipment and details: The goal ring and net are standard netball/hoop style mounted at regulation height; court lines are crisp and painted; players wear pinnies/bibs over outer garments; base anchoring of the post uses improvised weights (sacks and bricks) secured with a rope tied to the post.

### totaltext

Figure: Close-up of a neon sign reading "ATHENS" in uppercase letters. Each character is formed from thick glass tubing with a bright cyan outer glow and a vivid white-to-pale interior; there is a saturated red fill or inner glow visible inside the letter shapes. The letters are set against a very dark (near-black) background, creating strong contrast and prominent neon halos. The word is rendered on a slight horizontal arc, letters evenly spaced and slightly rounded in a vintage diner/neon-script style; joints and bends of the glass tubing are visible at letter corners, and the overall image is a tight crop focusing solely on the illuminated lettering with no surrounding context.

**Figure — Refrigerator interior with multiple small yogurt jars**

Alt text: Open refrigerator showing an upper shelf directly under a freezer compartment. The upper shelf is filled across its width with small glass jars with white lids and colorful labels (many read "Toni"); a middle glass shelf below holds three packaged items; two clear crisper drawers are visible at the bottom. Interior light on the right illuminates the contents.

Detailed description:
- Overall scene
  - Refrigerator interior photographed straight-on with freezer compartment (white door) at the very top of the frame.
  - Interior surfaces are white molded plastic; the right side has three molded door shelves (empty) visible in profile.
  - A warm interior light on the right side casts a yellowish glow across the shelves and jars.

- Upper/main shelf (immediately under the freezer)
  - Occupies the central third of the image and is a single glass shelf supported by molded ledges.
  - The shelf is densely populated by small, squat glass jars with white screw lids arranged in multiple rows across the depth and width of the shelf.
  - Many jars bear a blue label with the brand name "Toni" prominently printed; labels include colorful fruit imagery and vary in background color (pink/purple, yellow/cream, light blue).
  - Jar lid tops are mostly white with small printed elements; jars are positioned so labels face forward and are aligned in roughly straight rows.
  - At least one jar on the far right has a distinct orange-yellow label and is slightly separated from the main block of jars.

- Middle shelf (below the jar-filled shelf)
  - A single glass shelf that holds three packaged food items placed side-by-side, centered on the shelf:
    - Left: a red-wrapped bar (rectangular soft pack) lying flat with white lettering visible.
    - Center-left: a narrow blue-wrapped bar with a small cartoon or logo visible at one end.
    - Center-right: a rectangular item wrapped in silver foil with a black-and-colored-striped paper band on top (appears to be a confection or chocolate bar).
    - Right: a vacuum- or plastic-wrapped rectangular block with a beige interior and a red-and-white label on top (likely a packaged cheese or similar).
  - The items are spaced with a small gap between the silver-wrapped product and the beige block.

- Lower area
  - Two clear plastic crisper drawers are visible at the bottom of the image; their fronts are transparent with a slightly frosted top edge.
  - The area between the crisper drawers and the middle shelf is empty except for reflections and the rear interior wall.

- Lighting, reflections, and material notes
  - The glass shelves produce faint reflections of the jars and wrapped items.
  - The warm right-side lamp creates stronger highlights on the jar lids and the right edge of the glass shelf.
  - Plastic molded door shelving at the right shows stepped compartments for bottles or small items; they are currently empty.

Caption: Open refrigerator showing a full top shelf of small "Toni" jars (various fruit-label colors), a middle shelf with four packaged items (red bar, blue bar, foil-wrapped bar, beige block with red label), and two clear crisper drawers below, all lit by a right-side interior lamp.

### vqa_scene_text_all

Figure: Hardin County road signs — detailed description

- Central subject: two vertically stacked rectangular green county road signs mounted on a metal post attached to a wooden utility pole.
  - Top sign: dark green background with white text reading "HARDIN COUNTY" in small caps at the very top, the large numeral "265" centered below it, and the word "ROAD" in smaller white letters at the bottom.
  - Bottom sign: similar design and color, with "HARDIN COUNTY" at top, the large numeral "144" centered, and "ROAD" at the bottom. The bottom sign is slightly rotated relative to the top sign and is positioned directly beneath it on the same mounting assembly.
  - Both signs show typical reflective white lettering on a dark green field; edges of the signs are rounded.

- Supporting elements:
  - A tall wooden utility pole rises behind and slightly to the left of the signs, with multiple electrical cables and guy-wires fanning upward and diagonally across the sky toward the upper left corner of the frame.
  - The signpost and utility pole occupy the left-central foreground of the image; the signs are photographed from slightly below, giving a modest upward perspective.

- Background and environment:
  - A two-lane paved road stretches away from the camera toward the right-center of the image, narrowing into the distance and implying a rural roadway. The road surface appears dark and smooth; no clear lane markings are visible in the immediate foreground.
  - On the right side of the frame, the back (non-reflective side) of an octagonal stop sign is visible, oriented toward traffic coming from the right. The stop sign is unlit and shows its plain grey backside in silhouette.
  - Low, single-story residential buildings and a detached garage or shed sit on the left side of the road in the middle distance. A parked vehicle is visible near one of the buildings.
  - Utility poles and wires continue along the road into the distance, punctuating the roadside at regular intervals.

- Vegetation and seasonality:
  - Deciduous trees with foliage in muted tones line the horizon and flank the road; the colors suggest late autumn (leaves are sparse and tones are brownish/orange).
  - Short grass and low vegetation occupy the immediate roadside areas near the buildings.

- Sky and lighting:
  - The sky fills the upper two-thirds of the image with a dramatic pattern of mid- to high-level clouds (broken stratocumulus/cirrus mix), showing patches of pale blue and areas of warmer light near the horizon.
  - Lighting is soft and diffuse with a warm tint near the horizon, suggesting sunrise or sunset conditions; the signs and pole show even, low-contrast illumination with some shadowing consistent with low-angle light.

- Perspective and composition:
  - The photograph is composed with the sign cluster slightly left of center, creating visual emphasis on the numerals "265" and "144".
  - Leading lines from the road and the row of utility poles draw the eye into the distance to the right.
  - Foreground elements (signs, pole) are in sharp focus; background elements (houses, distant poles) are slightly less detailed due to depth of field and atmospheric perspective.

- Materials and condition:
  - The signs appear in good condition with clear, legible lettering and intact mounting hardware.
  - The wooden utility pole shows natural weathering; metal mounting brackets and fasteners are visible at the sign attachments.

- Notable absence:
  - No people are present in the scene.
  - No visible signage text besides the county and road numbers on the green signs; no commercial signage is apparent.

# Should I Return My Small-Business Loan? (Updated)

STIMULUS

*It's a good question. And with the SBA PPP deadline looming, we sought out an expert to answer it.*

Image: Hero photo of a small storefront with a peaked roof and a rectangular green sign reading "Jimmy's" mounted above the entrance. The building has a brown shingled fascia with two industrial-style gooseneck lamps hanging over the front. Windows flank the central door, and many leafless deciduous trees fill the background against an overcast sky. The composition centers on the sign and storefront, conveying a small, local business in a quiet, winter-like setting.
